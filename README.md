CLIENT'S REQUIREMENTS

1. "Are discounts a smart long-term tool, or do they cheapen our brand and attract bad 
customers?" (Q1, Q2, Q3) 
2. "Where should I spend my marketing budget for the best return?" (Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9) 
3. "What makes our customers loyal, and how can I get more of them?" (Q2, Q12) 
4. "What's my roadmap for consistent, year-round growth?" (Q10, Q11)

I recommended this strategy below based on a thorough analysis of the data, combined with my professional knowledge and experience. The rationale behind why this strategy is appropriate and the likelihood of its success are supported by detailed insights derived from SQL analysis. The key findings and numerical evidence identified through SQL clearly justify this strategy, which can be reviewed in the SQL reports and PDF analysis. For greater clarity and better visualization, the results are also presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Based on the answers, here is the 3-Part Strategy your client is probably crafting: 
Part 1: The Growth Engine (Acquisition) 
 Action: Use discounts aggressively and without fear. 
 Reason: Data proves discounts bring a flood of new customers (54.56% sales lift) who 
become just as loyal (86% repeat rate) as full-price buyers. The small per-sale cost is a 
worthy investment. 
 Tactic: Launch targeted discount campaigns for new customer segments, in low-season 
months, or in specific cities like Ankara/Gaziantep where repeat rates are slightly lower. 
Part 2: The Profit Protector (Optimization) 
 Action: Double down on Mobile and fix the "Middle Frustration" zone. 
 Reason: 
o 55.92% of sales are on mobile. A poor mobile experience is a revenue leak. 
o Customers who browse 5-16 minutes give lower ratings. This is the "hesitation zone" 
where they might be confused or frustrated. 
 Tactic: 
1. Make the mobile site and checkout process blazing fast. 
2. Improve product info, filters, and support for users in the 5-16 minute browse 
window to convert their hesitation into a confident purchase. 
Part 3: The Loyalty Loop (Retention) 
 Action: Launch a structured "First-Purchase to Fan" program. 
 Reason: The golden insight is that the first experience (discount or not) determines loyalty. 
86% of customers return. 
 Tactic: 
1. Immediately after first purchase, engage them with a thank-you, request a review 
(they rate 3.9/5 on average), and offer a smart, personalized incentive for 
their second purchase. 
2. Focus special retention efforts on Beauty & Electronics buyers, who show the highest 
repeat rates after a discount. 
3. Use data to re-engage customers before they forget you, especially during predicted 
low-sales months.
