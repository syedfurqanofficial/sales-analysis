📊 From Data to Strategy: Unlocking Growth with Evidence-Based Insights

Our client asked critical questions about discounts, marketing ROI, customer loyalty, and sustainable growth.
We didn’t just guess—we analyzed.

Using SQL queries, detailed data analysis, and interactive Power BI dashboards, we uncovered clear, actionable insights that shape our 3-Part Strategy for Sustainable Growth.

🎯 The 3-Part Data-Backed Strategy

Part 1: The Growth Engine (Acquisition)
➡ Action: Use discounts confidently and strategically.
➡ Why: Data shows discounts drive a 54.56% sales lift with an 86% repeat customer rate—just as loyal as full-price buyers.
➡ Tactic: Launch targeted discount campaigns for new segments, during low-season months, or in cities like Ankara/Gaziantep to boost engagement.

Part 2: The Profit Protector (Optimization)
➡ Action: Double down on Mobile UX and fix the “Middle Frustration” zone.
➡ Why:

55.92% of sales happen on mobile.

Users browsing 5–16 minutes show lower satisfaction—a clear hesitation zone.
➡ Tactic:

Optimize mobile site speed and checkout flow.

Improve product info and support for mid-funnel browsers to boost conversion.

Part 3: The Loyalty Loop (Retention)
➡ Action: Launch a “First-Purchase to Fan” program.
➡ Why: The first experience defines loyalty—86% of customers return.
➡ Tactic:

Post-purchase engagement: thank you, review requests, and personalized second-purchase offers.

Focus on high-retention segments like Beauty & Electronics buyers.

Re-engage customers before drop-off, especially in predicted low-sales months.
